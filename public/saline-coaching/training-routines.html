                    <h3>What is a split?</h3>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to lifting weights, there are an overwhleming number of exercises to choose from. Dividing them up into groups and 
                        creating whats called a "split", will help to maximize the effectiveness of any exercises you choose. A split will usually select 
                        specifics muscles or groups of muscles to target on certain days. For example, the most primitive split would be to designate each 
                        muscle to its own day. <br>Let's look at this sort of split:
                    </p>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Monday</th>
                            <th>Tuesday</th>
                            <th>Wednesday</th>
                            <th>Thursday</th>
                            <th>Friday</th>
                            <th>Saturday</th>
                            <th>Sunday</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Chest</td>
                            <td>Back</td>
                            <td>Legs</td>
                            <td>Shoulders</td>
                            <td>Triceps</td>
                            <td>Biceps</td>
                            <td>REST</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p>
                        The issue with this split is that you are only hitting each muscle group once a week. So after you work your chest, 
                        it will recover and then sit around waiting to be worked again next week. This is not efficient to build muscle since you are 
                        essentially wasting time while certain muscles are already fully recovered, but not getting reworked.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Push Pull Legs</h3>
                    <p>
                        The most commmon split today at least amongst teenagers and young adults is "Push Pull Legs". The method with this type of split 
                        is to fit all exercises into 3 separate days in order to hit them twice a week. All pushing related exercises (usually these are
                        chest, triceps and shoulders lifts) are done in one day, pull exercises (usually back and biceps) are another day, and then legs
                        would be the last day. <br>Let's see how this split would look in a week:
                    </p>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Monday</th>
                            <th>Tuesday</th>
                            <th>Wednesday</th>
                            <th>Thursday</th>
                            <th>Friday</th>
                            <th>Saturday</th>
                            <th>Sunday</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Push</td>
                            <td>Pull</td>
                            <td>Legs</td>
                            <td>Push</td>
                            <td>Pull</td>
                            <td>Legs</td>
                            <td>REST</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p>
                        You can see that this split requires the same six days a week commitment, but is much more efficient as muscles will recover
                        and then quickly be reworked.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Custom Split</h3>
                    <p>
                        While the basic default splits are great, they don't account for the differences in everybodies lives. Most people may find that six 
                        days a week in the gym is too many, I can easily work around that. You give me your availability, I work to provide you with a 
                        routine that fits your needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another crucial part of what you need from a custom split, is exercise selection that will help you meet your goals. Trying to lose 
                        bodyfat? Then, you would benefit from more cardio and less weight lifting. Strength? You will need exercises that allow you to easily
                        add weight without putting you at risk for injury. Everyone wants something different, so why follow what someone else is doing. Let 
                        me do the hard part, so you can focus on consistency.
                    </p>
                    <p>                        
                        Here is a sample routine for someone who wants to build overall strength (my current split):
                    </p>

                        <tr>

                            <th>Tuesday</th>
                            <th>Wednesday</th>
                            <th>Thursday</th>
                            <th>Friday</th>
                            <th>Saturday</th>
                            <th>Sunday</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Heavy squat</td>
                            <td>Heavy bench</td>
                            <td>REST</td>
