                    <h3>What do you eat?</h3>
                    <p>
                        What does a typical week look like when it comes to your diet? Is it nutrient dense, or are you just barely surviving off multivitamins?
                        Do you find yourself stuck trying to lose weight, and when you diet through the day you make up for it by binging at night? There is an
                        overwhelming number of Americans particularly that seem to be more ignorant than children when it comes to nutrition.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                        The key to acheiving your goals with respect to dieting is by understanding the food you are eating. Restrictive diets such as keto, no-carb, and
                        others featured in the current issue of a health magazine all fall short at the same point. They don't teach you what the problem is with
                        your current diet, and instead just offer a temporary solution that you will grow to despise almost as soon as you start it.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                        <em>Caloric density</em><br>
                        Scary phrase, isn't it? This should not be the case. It simply refers to the number of calories you see on
                        the label relative to how much food you are consuming. Let's make sense of this. Eating 3 whole chocolate bars would likely not pose
                        too large of a challenge, however, at roughly 200 calories per bar, you just ate 600 calories in 2 minutes and will be hungry in 20 minutes. 
                        Now what if you attempted to
                        eat 2 whole cups of egg whites, with a large handful of spinach, and 2 english muffins. This would take some time, maybe 5-10 minutes
                        depending on how quick you eat. This meal was also 600 caloires, but will keep you full for anywhere from 1-4 hours.<br>
                        What is the point? That not all food is equal, especially when talking about calories.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                        Now that you understand the basics of why selection of food is important, I will just put the facts in front of you and you can sort it
                        out in your head.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Weight loss, gain, and maintenance are all fully dependent on calories.</li>
                        <li>Your body burns a certain amount of calories just to keep you alive, this is called your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).</li>
                        <li>The amount of caloires you burn in a day is your BMR plus all calories burned through any type of exercise (including daily steps).</li>
                        <li>In order to lose weight, you must eat less calories than you burn.</li>
                        <li>In order to gain weight, you must eat more calories than you burn.</li>
                        <li>To remain the same weight, you must eat the same amount of calories that you burn.</li>
                        <li>To achieve any of the above 3 goals, you must know which foods will help you do so.</li>
                    </ul>
