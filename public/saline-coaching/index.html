                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        My name is Joey Saline and I am currently enrolled at the University at Albany. This year I am going into my senior year, which means 
                        I have been lifting weights for roughly 7 years. I first touched the weight room my freshman year of high school at the school gym. Although 
                        I did not know what I was doing at the time, I always felt better leaving than I did entering. This feeling has yet to subside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I went on and off throughout high school, but the important part was how interested I was in learning about different ways to 
                        achieve better results. I spent most of my free time watching YouTube and collecting information on how to properly do different exercises, 
                        as well as how to better structure my routine and diet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the time I was a sophomore in college, I felt like I knew everything there was to know about training and nutrition. I encouraged 
                        two of my close friends who are two years younger to go to the gym and experience all the benefits waiting for them. So, I took 
                        it upon myself to coach them, and after just a month and a half they both looked considerably different from where they started.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During this time period I would workout alongside them as they would follow my training routine, and I would demonstrate proper 
                        form for each exercise. Constantly I was unleashing the knowledge I gathered over many years, and informing them of every miniscule aspect 
                        that could make a difference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, I am proud to say they both surpassed me and maintain much better consistency than I do while away at college. At this point 
                        my lifestyle is nowhere near healthy while I am away at college, so my knowledge definetely surpasses my physical appearance. 
                        This website will showcase different services that I could offer as a personal coach if I had decided to pursue this career path.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Aspirations</h3>
                    <p>
                        My priorites have shifted over the years and I am becoming a lot more health conscious. I realized that my body is very injury prone, 
                        or at least I would push myself to the point of injury, and I aim to slowly and more carefully progress to my goals. I also find 
                        that taking in sufficient nutrients through my diet is crucial to solving my problem of getting sick every other week. I am known to be 
                        the first one of my friends to get sick, and then spread that sickness around. Ensuring my immune system stays healthy is now another 
                        of my priorites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For lifting, I stopped caring about what I look as much, and now I really want to see my limits when it comes to strength. I never 
                        intentionally tried to get stronger on traditional powerlifting lifts before. My numbers always sat dormant even though I would train 
                        consistently. Once I hit 225 lbs on bench around 2 years ago, I never progressed to anything substantially heavier. My current heaviest
                        bench press is 245 lbs, heaviest squat is 325 lbs, and deadlift is just 385 lbs. I am aiming to bring my squat up to 405 lbs, my bench 
                        to 315 lbs, and my deadlift to 495 lbs. I believe I could accomplish all of that within a year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope to continue my lifting journey well into my life after I settle into my career. As a Computer Science major, I do not see much 
                        activity in my future, so I am determined to maintain a healthy lifestyle and continue to set new goals down the line.
